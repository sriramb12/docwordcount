corpuswordcount.py -- This is a pyspark routine to count words in a corpus 
gencorpus.py -- generates a corpus of 30000 documents from a dictionary built using a web source
              Each document can have a count of words between 2000 to 20000 words

TODO: use spark to generate a corpus as well?
